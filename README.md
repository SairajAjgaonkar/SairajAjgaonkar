### 🧭 **My Journey: From Frames to Forecasts**  
My professional story began in the world of creativity — where I led animation teams, coordinated production pipelines, and brought visual concepts to life. But over time, I became more fascinated by the **"why" behind behaviors**, the **"what" in the trends**, and the **"how" that drives smarter decisions**.  

That passion sparked my transition into the world of **data analytics** — a space where I now combine creativity, logic, and precision to decode patterns, visualize data stories, and fuel data-informed decisions.
